# Phase 2 Development Status

## Current Phase: Tests First (TDD)

**Objective**: Create failing tests before any implementation to ensure proper TDD approach.

## Squad Progress Tracking

### ✅ Setup Complete (Phase 1)

- [x] T001 - Turborepo monorepo initialized
- [x] T002 - Microfrontend structure created
- [x] T003 - Shared packages configured
- [x] T004 - Development tooling setup
- [x] T005 - Docker configuration
- [x] T006 - Database schema and Prisma

### 🔄 Phase 2: Tests First (In Progress)

#### Squad Gateway (API) - PRIORITY

**Branch**: `gateway/api-implementation` **Status**: Ready to start

**Critical Path Tasks**:

- [ ] T007 - Product model tests ⚠️ FAILING (Expected)
- [ ] T008 - Customer model tests ⚠️ FAILING (Expected)
- [ ] T009 - Order model tests ⚠️ FAILING (Expected)
- [ ] T010 - Cart model tests ⚠️ FAILING (Expected)
- [ ] T011 - Payment model tests ⚠️ FAILING (Expected)
- [ ] T012 - Products API contract tests ⚠️ FAILING (Expected)
- [ ] T013 - Customers API contract tests ⚠️ FAILING (Expected)
- [ ] T014 - Orders API contract tests ⚠️ FAILING (Expected)
- [ ] T015 - Cart API contract tests ⚠️ FAILING (Expected)
- [ ] T016 - Payments API contract tests ⚠️ FAILING (Expected)

#### Squad Atlas (Storefront)

**Branch**: `atlas/storefront-implementation`  
**Status**: Ready to start

**Tasks**:

- [ ] T017 - Browsing flow integration tests ⚠️ FAILING (Expected)

#### Squad Orion (Checkout)

**Branch**: `orion/checkout-implementation` **Status**: Ready to start

**Tasks**:

- [ ] T018 - Checkout process integration tests ⚠️ FAILING (Expected)

#### Squad Nova (Account)

**Branch**: `nova/account-implementation` **Status**: Ready to start

**Tasks**:

- [ ] T019 - Account management integration tests ⚠️ FAILING (Expected)

#### Squad Mercury (Admin)

**Branch**: `mercury/admin-implementation` **Status**: Ready to start

**Tasks**:

- [ ] T020 - Admin operations integration tests ⚠️ FAILING (Expected)

## Next Steps for Each Squad

### Immediate Actions (Today)

1. **All Squads**:

   ```bash
   # Switch to your squad branch
   git checkout [your-squad-branch]

   # Install dependencies (if not done)
   pnpm install

   # Run existing tests to see failures
   pnpm test
   ```

2. **Squad Gateway (CRITICAL PATH)**:
   - Start implementing models to make T007-T011 pass
   - Then implement API endpoints for T012-T016
   - Other squads depend on your API being ready

3. **Frontend Squads (Atlas, Orion, Nova, Mercury)**:
   - Create additional failing tests for your domain
   - Start building UI components using @acme/ui
   - Mock API calls until Gateway squad delivers

### Development Schedule

#### Week 1 (Current)

- **Phase 2**: All failing tests written ⚠️
- **Gateway Squad**: Models and basic API endpoints

#### Week 2

- **Phase 3**: Core implementation begins
- **Frontend Squads**: UI components and basic flows
- **Gateway Squad**: Authentication and integration

#### Week 3

- **Phase 4**: Integration between squads
- **All Squads**: Cross-team testing and bug fixes

#### Week 4

- **Phase 5**: Polish, performance, documentation
- **All Squads**: Final testing and deployment prep

## Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests for specific squad
pnpm test --filter=@acme/api           # Gateway
pnpm test --filter=@acme/mfe-storefront # Atlas
pnpm test --filter=@acme/mfe-checkout   # Orion
pnpm test --filter=@acme/mfe-account    # Nova
pnpm test --filter=@acme/mfe-admin      # Mercury

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test --watch

# Run integration tests
pnpm test:e2e
```

## Blockers and Dependencies

### Current Blockers

- None (Phase 2 can start immediately)

### Dependencies

- Frontend squads need Gateway API contracts
- Payment flow needs Stripe integration
- Authentication needs Clerk setup

### Risk Mitigation

- Use mock data for frontend development
- Create stub API endpoints early
- Implement feature flags for incomplete features

## Success Criteria for Phase 2

- [ ] All tests written and failing appropriately ⚠️
- [ ] Test coverage targets: >80% unit, >70% integration
- [ ] No implementation code (only test code)
- [ ] All squads have clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline running tests successfully

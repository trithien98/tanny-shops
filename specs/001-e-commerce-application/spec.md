## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

Customers need a comprehensive online shopping platform where they can browse products, make secure purchases, and manage their accounts. Business administrators need tools to manage inventory, orders, and customer data. The platform must support multiple development teams working independently on different features without blocking each other.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Customer Shopping Journey:**

1. **Given** a customer visits the site, **When** they browse product categories, **Then** they see organized product listings with search and filtering capabilities
2. **Given** a customer finds a product, **When** they view product details, **Then** they see comprehensive information including price, description, and availability
3. **Given** a customer wants to purchase, **When** they add items to cart and proceed to checkout, **Then** they can complete payment securely with order confirmation

**Account Management:** 4. **Given** a registered customer, **When** they access their account, **Then** they can view order history, manage addresses, and update preferences 5. **Given** a customer with orders, **When** they track an order, **Then** they see current status and delivery information

**Administrative Operations:** 6. **Given** an administrator, **When** they access admin tools, **Then** they can manage product catalog, inventory, and customer orders 7. **Given** an admin user, **When** they need to process returns or refunds, **Then** they have tools to handle customer service operations

**Team Development:** 8. **Given** multiple development teams, **When** they work on different features, **Then** they can develop, test, and deploy independently without conflicts

### Edge Cases

- What happens when payment processing fails during checkout?
- How does system handle inventory conflicts when multiple customers purchase the last item?
- What occurs when a team's feature deployment affects other team's functionality?
- How are customer data and privacy handled during account deletion?
